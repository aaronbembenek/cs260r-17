Problem set 4
-------------

Merge this problem set with your code with

    git pull git://github.com/readablesystems/cs260r-17 master

(or do a pull or merge using GitHub).

Then finish the marked exercises in the `pset4osview.v` file.

Thereâ€™s a lot of library stuff to absorb in this pset, and since we are
working with a whole OS model (rather than something with a simple spec, like
mergesort or regular expressions), the lemma statements are tricky. But the
proofs themselves are not ridiculously long. My solutions file is <200 lines
longer than the problem set file.

More exercises may be released.

Due Sunday 3/26 at midnight.
