Problem set 3
-------------

Merge this problem set with your code with

    git pull git://github.com/readablesystems/cs260r-17 master

(or do a pull or merge using GitHub).

Then finish the marked exercises in the `pset3sort.v` and `pset3regex.v` files.
The sort exercises are probably easier.

This problem set gives you a lot of rope. Do not hang yourself.

Due Wednesday 2/22 at midnight.
